# Dos-Sites-Tester
Greetings to all who have visited this page!

I want to warn you right away: I am not responsible for the actions committed using this program. This program is designed EXCLUSIVELY FOR TESTING YOUR OWN WEBSITES.

In the archive you will find Python installers for various operating systems. If you do not have Python version 3.13 installed, you need to:

    Run the installer from the archive corresponding to your operating system, or install Python yourself.

After installing Python:

    Navigate to the folder corresponding to your operating system.

    Run the file starter.py .

If you have any questions or difficulties, be sure to specify your operating system and Python version before starting work.

Good luck with testing!
